I wrote this to create the environment needed to test a ansilbe module, ecs_tag.

Yes, I know I should have written a playbook on ansible to setup this environment.  I used terraform for 2 reasons.  First I did this already at work using ansible.  Seconds, I want ot become preficient in Terraform.

Make sure you change variables.tf to match your environment.
